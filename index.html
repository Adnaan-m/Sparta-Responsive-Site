          <h4>Kauai</h4>
          <h4>Hawaii</h4>
          <p>Kauai is Hawaii's fourth largest island and is sometimes called the "Garden Isle" which is an entirely accurate description. The oldest and northernmost island in the Hawaiian chain is draped in emerald valleys, sharp mountain spires and jagged cliffs, aged by time and the elements. Centuries of growth have formed tropical rainforests, forking rivers and cascading waterfalls. Some parts of Kauai are only accessible by sea or air, revealing views beyond your imagination.</p>

          <p>Zhangye's Danxia landscape has lots of precipitous red cliffs, most of which are several hundred meters high, and multicolored ridges of weathered strata, sometimes stretching to the horizon. These formations, sometimes smooth sometimes sharp, stand out against the greens or grays of the plains , looking grand and magnificent, vigorous and virile.	</p>

          <h4>Rice Terrace Fields</h4>
          <h4>China</h4>
          <p>The Longsheng Rice Terraces, also called the Longji Rice Terraces are located in Longsheng County, about 100 kilometres from Guilin, Guangxi, China. The terraced fields are built along the slope winding from the riverside up to the mountain top, between 600 to 800 metres above sea level.A coiling terrace line that starts from the mountain foot up to the mountain top divides the mountain into layers of water in spring, layers of green rice shoots in summer, layers of rice in fall, and layers of frost in winter. The terraced fields were mostly built about 650 years ago.</p>
